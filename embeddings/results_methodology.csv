applsci-11-10979,methodology,Methodology 方法论,"The methodology used in the study involved converting skeleton data into pose evolution images (PEIs) to classify behaviors of elderly and young adults using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The PEIs were then analyzed using the Grad-CAM method to determine the contribution to the classification results. The skeleton-heatmap was obtained to facilitate the analysis of behavioral characteristics. The study utilized the ETRI-Activity3D dataset, which collected behavioral data from Kinect sensors for both elderly and young adults. The analysis was conducted by comparing the skeleton-heatmaps between the two groups to understand their unique behavioral characteristics. The study aimed to use deep learning and explainable AI to analyze the differences in behavioral characteristics between elderly and young adults based on cognitive science."
Towards_a_robust_robotic_assistant_for_Comprehensive_Geriatric_Assessment_procedures_updating_the_CLARC_system,methodology,Methodology 方法论,"The methodology used in the research project described in the provided text involves developing a socially assistive robot system called CLARC to assist clinicians in conducting Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) procedures. The methodology includes designing and implementing the robot hardware, cognitive software architecture, and the CGAMed platform for managing data and interactions. The system is evaluated through user-centered approaches, including questionnaires, debriefing sessions, and interviews to assess the execution of CGA tests, robot autonomy and behavior, and usability of the interface for clinicians. Feedback from users is collected to guide improvements in the system for the final phase of the project. The methodology also involves adjusting interfaces, incorporating cloud-based software, and enhancing the cognitive software architecture to address challenges and improve system performance."
Psychometric_Evaluation_Supported_by_a_Social_Robot_Personality_Factors_and_Technology_Acceptance,methodology,Methodology 方法论,"The methodology used in the study involved a comparative analysis between a robotic cognitive assessment tool and traditional paper-and-pencil psychometric tests. Elderly participants were administered both types of assessments, and their performance was evaluated. Personality factors and technology acceptance were also assessed to understand their influence on the cognitive test results. Statistical analyses, such as correlations and regression, were conducted to analyze the data collected. The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptance of using social robots for cognitive assessment in elderly individuals."
