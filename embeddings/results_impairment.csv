applsci-11-10979,impairment,Cognitive and physical impairment 认知和身体障碍,"The article discusses the analysis of behavioral characteristics of the elderly and young adults based on deep learning techniques. It focuses on converting skeleton data into pose evolution images (PEIs) to classify behaviors using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The study aims to improve elderly care systems and welfare by understanding the differences in physical conditions and behaviors between the elderly and young adults. The research uses the ETRI-Activity3D dataset to analyze these behavioral characteristics. However, the article does not specifically address cognitive impairment or cognitive science. If you are looking for information on cognitive and physical impairment, you may need to refer to additional sources or studies specifically related to those topics."

Psychometric_Evaluation_Supported_by_a_Social_Robot_Personality_Factors_and_Technology_Acceptance,impairment,Cognitive and physical impairment 认知和身体障碍,"The study discussed in the provided context focuses on the cognitive assessment of elderly participants using a robotic platform. It compares the performance of participants on cognitive tests administered by a social humanoid robot with traditional paper-and-pencil psychometric tools. The study aims to explore the influence of personality factors and technology acceptance on cognitive test performance. The results show the validity of robotic cognitive assessment and highlight the positive influence of personality traits like Openness to experience on interaction with the robot. However, the study does not specifically address physical impairment."
