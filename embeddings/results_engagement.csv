applsci-11-10979,engagement,Engagement 参与度,The research presented in the article focuses on analyzing the behavioral characteristics of elderly individuals and young adults using deep learning techniques. The study involves converting skeleton data into pose evolution images (PEIs) and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify behaviors. The analysis is done using explainable AI methods like Grad-CAM to understand the features contributing to the classification. The results are then visualized through skeleton-heatmaps to compare the behavioral characteristics between the elderly and young adults. The goal is to provide insights into the unique behavioral patterns of these two groups. The study aims to improve elderly welfare systems and automate elderly care services using silver robots.
Towards_a_robust_robotic_assistant_for_Comprehensive_Geriatric_Assessment_procedures_updating_the_CLARC_system,engagement,Engagement 参与度,"Based on the provided context, the term ""engagement"" in this scenario could refer to the level of involvement, interaction, or participation of patients, clinicians, and users with the CLARC system. It may encompass how actively individuals are interacting with the robot, how satisfied they are with the system, and how effectively they are using the interfaces and features provided. The engagement could be measured through feedback, evaluations, usability testing, and observations of the users' interactions with the robot during Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment procedures."
Psychometric_Evaluation_Supported_by_a_Social_Robot_Personality_Factors_and_Technology_Acceptance,engagement,Engagement 参与度,"The study mentioned in the context focuses on the engagement of elderly participants with a robotic cognitive assessment tool. It discusses how factors like personality traits and technology acceptance influence the engagement levels during the interaction with the robot. The results suggest that the Openness to experience personality factor positively influences engagement with the robot. Additionally, the Anxiety factor correlates with visuo-spatial capabilities, Trust correlates with attention scores, and Intention to use correlates with delayed recall. These findings contribute to understanding how engagement levels are affected by various factors during human-robot interactions."
