applsci-11-10979,additional_info,Additional info 其他信息,"The article discussed in the context provides a detailed explanation of how deep learning techniques are used to analyze the behavioral characteristics of elderly individuals and young adults. The study focuses on converting skeleton data into pose evolution images (PEIs) and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify behaviors. The analysis includes the use of explainable AI methods like Grad-CAM to interpret the results. The research aims to improve elderly welfare systems and automate elderly care through the analysis of behavioral patterns. The dataset used for the study is the ETRI-Activity3D dataset, which contains behavioral data collected from Kinect sensors.

Psychometric_Evaluation_Supported_by_a_Social_Robot_Personality_Factors_and_Technology_Acceptance,additional_info,Additional info 其他信息,"The additional information provided in the context includes details about the experimental setup, the specific cognitive and personality assessment tools used, the statistical analysis methods employed, and the results of the study. The study focused on the psychometric evaluation supported by a social robot, exploring the influence of personality factors and technology acceptance on cognitive test performance in elderly participants. The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of robotic cognitive assessment, explore the influence of personality factors, and assess the acceptance of the robotic platform by senior users. The results indicated a positive influence of Openness to experience on the interaction with the robot, correlations between personality factors and cognitive scores, and associations between technology acceptance and cognitive performance."
