Psychometric_Evaluation_Supported_by_a_Social_Robot_Personality_Factors_and_Technology_Acceptance,key_findings,"Please provide a concise answer without additional explanations. If the information is not available, simply respond with 'N/A'. What are the key findings of the study?","The key findings of the study are:
1. Openness to experience positively influences the automatic scoring in the robotic cognitive assessment.
2. Anxiety correlates moderately with supervised visuospatial capabilities.
3. Trust has a negative correlation with supervised attention scores.
4. Intention to use correlates with supervised delayed recall.
5. The UTAUT questionnaire results show positive perceptions of adaptability, sociability, and usefulness of the robot.
6. Linear regression analysis confirms that Openness to experience significantly contributes to the automatic robotic score."
